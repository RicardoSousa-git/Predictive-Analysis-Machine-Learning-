# Predictive-Analysis-Machine-Learning---Coursera

This repository consists of a predictive analysis using machine learning
The predicted result is if the Stage 1 of the Falcon 9 launches will land successfully or not
Four machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) are compared to see which model has the best accuracy
